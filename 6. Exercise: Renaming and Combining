## 1. `region_1` and `region_2` are pretty uninformative names for locale columns in the dataset. Create a copy of `reviews` with these columns renamed to `region` and `locale`, respectively.
ANS: renamed = reviews.rename(columns={'region_1':'region', 'region_2': 'locale'})

## 2.Set the index name in the dataset to `wines`.
ANS: reindexed = review.rename_axis('wines', axis='rows')

## 3. The [Things on Reddit]dataset includes product links from a selection of top-ranked forums ("subreddits") on reddit.com. Run the cell below to load a dataframe of products mentioned on the */r/gaming* subreddit and another dataframe for products mentioned on the *r//movies* subreddit.
Create a `DataFrame` of products mentioned on *either* subreddit.
ANS: combined_products = pd.concat([gaming_products, movie_products])

## 4. The [Powerlifting Database] dataset on Kaggle includes one CSV table for powerlifting meets and a separate one for powerlifting competitors. Run the cell below to load these datasets into dataframes:
Both tables include references to a `MeetID`, a unique key for each meet (competition) included in the database. Using this, generate a dataset combining the two tables into one.
ANS: left = powerlifting_meets.set_index(['MeetID'])
     right = powerlifting_competitors.set_index(['MeetID'])
     powerlifting_combined = left.join(right)
