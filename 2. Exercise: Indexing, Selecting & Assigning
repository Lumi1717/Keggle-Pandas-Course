## 1. Select the `description` column from `reviews` and assign the result to the variable `desc`.

ANS: desc = reviews.description

Follow-up question: what type of object is `desc`? If you're not sure, you can check by calling Python's `type` function: `type(desc)`.
ANS: type(desc)

## 2. Select the first value from the description column of `reviews`, assigning it to variable `first_description`.
ANS: first_description = reviews.loc[0,'description']

## 3. Select the first row of data (the first record) from `reviews`, assigning it to the variable `first_row`.
ANS: first_row = reviews.iloc[0]

## 4. Select the first 10 values from the `description` column in `reviews`, assigning the result to variable `first_descriptions`.

Hint: format your output as a pandas Series.
ANS:first_descriptions = reviews.loc[0:9,"description"]

## 5. Select the records with index labels `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`, assigning the result to the variable `sample_reviews`.
ANS: sample_reviews = reviews.loc[[1,2,3,5,8]]

## 6. Create a variable `df` containing the `country`, `province`, `region_1`, and `region_2` columns of the records with the index labels `0`, `1`, `10`, and `100`.
ANS:df = reviews.loc[[0,1,10,100],["country", "province", "region_1", "region_2"]]

## 7. Create a variable `df` containing the `country` and `variety` columns of the first 100 records. 

Hint: you may use `loc` or `iloc`. When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, keep the following "gotcha"

ANS: df = reviews.loc[:99,['country','variety']]

## 8. Create a DataFrame `italian_wines` containing reviews of wines made in `Italy`. 
Hint: `reviews.country` equals what?

ANS: italian_wines = reviews.loc[reviews.country == "Italy"]

## 9. Create a DataFrame `top_oceania_wines` containing all reviews with at least 95 points (out of 100) for wines from Australia or New Zealand.
ANS: top_oceania_wines = reviews.loc[reviews.country.isin(['Australia', 'New Zealand']) & (reviews.points >= 95),]
