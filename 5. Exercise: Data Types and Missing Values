## 1. What is the data type of the `points` column in the dataset?
ANS: dtype = reviews.points.dtype

## 2. Create a Series from entries in the `points` column, but convert the entries to strings. Hint: strings are `str` in native Python.
ANS: point_strings = reviews.points.astype('str')

## 3.Sometimes the price column is null. How many reviews in the dataset are missing a price?
ANS: n_missing_prices = reviews[pd.isnull(reviews.price)]
     nn_missing_prices = len(n_missing_prices)  (OR)
     n_missing_prices = reviews[pd.isnull(reviews.price)].sum()
     
## 4. What are the most common wine-producing regions? Create a Series counting the number of times each value occurs in the `region_1` field. This field is often missing data, so replace missing values with `Unknown`. Sort in descending order.  Your output should look something like this:
ANS: reviews_per_region = reviews.region_1.fillna('Unknown').value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False)
